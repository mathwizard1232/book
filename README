Initial work on a personal library management system.

On the main branch I have my initial attempt which uses Hibernate.

On the feature/reformat-project branch I have a version without Hibernate which
was contributed by @TheDecentTech as an example without Hibernate, as well as
refactored into a more typical idiom.

The main branch is currently working and has add a book / add a box / view authors
basic functionality.

The feature branch doesn't have all of the main branch functionality reimplemented yet.

In order to get the project working from the version in git, it is necessary to
configure application.properties with the following fields:

spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
spring.datasource.username=<username>
spring.datasource.password=<password>
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://<host>:<port>/<database>

One can also set

logging.level.com.nyancoin=TRACE

to change the logging level for the core program (while leaving the framework at normal
logging level because it is very noisy on higher levels).
